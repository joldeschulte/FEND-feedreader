# Project Overview

In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they had already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and I was left with an application with an incomplete test suite.  I completed the test suite.


## Open index.html to run the application

No other steps are required.  Jasmine will do its thing and you can see the tests that pass at the bottom of the page.
